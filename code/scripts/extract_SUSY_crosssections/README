# These files are for extracting the SUSY cross secitons from
the LHC SUSY Cross Sections website, for example from
https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/LHCPhysics/SUSYCrossSections8TeVgluglu

The output is the cross-section (in pb) for the process in crossx.out, and
the absolute error on the cross-section (in pb) in crossxerr.out. The comma
separated lists are perfect for copy/pasting into a C++ array.

Step 1) Copy/paste the table on the website into gogo.txt
Step 2) 
 user> ./extract_crossx.x gogo.txt
Step 3) Copy/paste these .out files into a C++ array for use
